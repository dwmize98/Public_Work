#How to run this program:
1. Simply run the command "make".
2. An executable file called BlocksworldAstar wil be generated.
3. Run the command "./BlocksworldAstar (name of bwp test file)"

This will then generate the answer and print out the steps line by line just like the examples provided in the pdf.

If an answer cannot be found due to too many iterations (over 100,000), then the program will end and the the message "Sorry a solution could not be found" will be printed. 

The outputs for the 45 challenge set problems are in a file called My_Stats.txt
