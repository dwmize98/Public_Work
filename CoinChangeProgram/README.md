Problem given:
Using the programming language of your choice, please create a program to solve the
problem below. In addition, please provide instructions to run the application.
Youâ€™re tasked with creating a program for making change. Your program should take as
an input the amount of change to make (e.g. 4.50), and it should output the number of
each coin to dispense so that the fewest possible coins are dispensed. The available
coins for you to use are quarters (.25), dimes (.10), nickels (.05), and pennies (.01).
Optional:
Extend this program so that it will work for any coin denominations (e.g. 6 cent coins).


- To compile and run this program simply run make (the following version was used for testing: g++ (Ubuntu 7.5.0-3ubuntu1~18.04) 7.5.0).
- The executable to run is exe.
- Do not enter any values less than 0.01 for a new denomination.
- Do not enter any values less than 0.01 to get change for.
- Type "quit" to end the program.
