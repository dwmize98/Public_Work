This repo is to showcase some school work and personal work I have done.

I have copied over programs from my Artificial Intelligence course as well as a programming assignment I did as part of an interview several months ago.

The README in each project folder will outline what files were provided by the professor. All other files were created and written by myself.

Within all of the AI projects there is also a pdf document outlining the problem being solved.
