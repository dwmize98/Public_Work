#How to run this program:
1. Simply run the command "make".
2. An executable file called exe wil be generated.
3. Run the command "./BlocksworldBFS (name of bwp test file)"

This will then generate the answer and print out the steps line by line just like the examples provided in the pdf.

If an answer cannot be found due to too many iterations (over 100,000), then the program will end and the the message "Sorry a solution could not be found" will be printed. 

There are 5 test cases in this directory, 1-4 should return an answer, 5 will not.

The outputs for test cases 1-3 are in a file called RESULTS
